  Quantum Computing Meets Type Theory:\\ A Framework for Certified Quantum Information Processing (EP/I020020/1)\\
  Response to Referee Comments\\[5pt]Thorsten Altenkirch and Alexander Green\\
\end{center}

\noindent 
All reviewers class the quality of the proposal as `excellent', and
reviewers MTBZQM and CFU8YZ come to the conclusion that the project is
`very strong' and `meets all the assessment criteria' with `high'
confidence. Indeed, referee CFU8YZ even remarks that this `is one of
the best proposals I have seen for some time'.

Only reviewer 94A25H, while positive in general, criticizes a lack
of detail and would have preferred `a more concrete outline of the
planned work'. However, the same referee states earlier that `the
work plan is detailed', which is echoed by MTBZQM who adds that
`Each work unit describes a detailed plan for addressing a
challenging problem'. It is hard to see how we could have added more
detail before actually carrying out the work.

94A25H continues by saying that the proposal `leaves
some doubts whether the proposed framework is suitable for handling
issues which arise in practical systems'. It is reasonable to have
these doubts and it seems that the only way to find out is by actually
undertaking the research proposed.

% Indeed, these doubts are
% very reasonable and it is a stated objective of our project to
% establish whether a type-theoretic framework of the kind we propose is
% suitable for practical systems, \textbf{or not!} 

In the impact section 94A25H agrees that `designers of quantum
systems, especially for cryptography, are good targets for this kind
of work', and suggests `a more detailed plan with a concrete route
towards working with a manufacturer would have strengthened the
proposal'.  Since the proposal has been submitted we have discussed
this question with Prof. Martin Plenio (University of Ulm), who has
suggested that MagiQ, a company specializing in communication hardware
based on quantum principles, could be relevant. We plan to follow this
up, if the project gets funded.

Finally, under resources and management, 94A25H points out that our
costings for PCs are not in accordance with the EPSRC specifications
but adds that `this is not important'. Indeed, we are happy to adjust
our costings to be in accordance with the specification and apologize
for any errors in this respect.
