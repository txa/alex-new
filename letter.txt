Dear colleagues,

Alexander Green and myself are preparing a research proposal to
continue work started in Alexander's PhD thesis. During his PhD work
Alexander developed a functional interface to quantum computing (the
Quantum IO monad) which can be extended to provide a type theoretic
framework for quantum computing. Like any other research proposal the
actual impact depends very much on the interaction with other
researchers which is also important for our case for support. Hence,
we are asking for feedback on our proposal and also offers for
potential collaborations, maybe letters of support. Also suggestions
to approach other people or groups are welcome. As it is frequently
the case we are under some time pressure and hope to be able to submit
a proposal by end of May.

I attach our draft case for support and also our draft impact
statement (this is a new requirement by EPSRC, any advice what to say
here would be particularly welcome).

Cheers,
Thorsten & Alex
