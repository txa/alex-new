Our primary beneficiaries are other researchers working in quantum
computing. The QIO framework we are developing will provide a tool
they can use to formally develop and certify their contributions in
different areas: the development of new quantum algorithms, the
development of physically realistic approaches or the development of
high level approaches to Quantum Information Processing. We also
envisage useful interactions with physicists, exploiting our existing
contacts to the quantum groups at Nottingham and Imperial college.

We have already exploited the Haskell QIO monad to teach quantum
computing at Nottingham. The QIO framework we would be developing in
this project would provide further opportunities to educate students
and the interested public in quantum information processing. This is
especially important, since prototypes are limited and hard to
construct.

It is generally believed that the development of a universal quantum
computer is at least five, if not ten, years away. In this respect the
benefits of our project are rather long term. On the other hand the
use of quantum based systems for unconditionally safe key
distribution, a corner stone for safe communication protocols, is
already the subject of startup companies.  In this area our framework
could provide commercially relevant certificates within the lifetime
of our project.
