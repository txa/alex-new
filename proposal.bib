In this paper we study the relation between reversible and irreversible computation applicable to different models of computation -- here we are considering classical and quantum computation. We develop an equational theory of reversible computations and an associated theory of irreversible computations which is obtained by marking some inputs as preinitialised heap and some outputs as garbage to be thrown away at the end of the computation. We present three laws which apply to irreversible classical and quantum computations and show that von Neumann's measurement postulate is derivable from them. We discuss the question whether these laws are complete for irreversible quantum computations."

The article concludes with a brief survey of current research activities and a tabular summary of a selection of QPLs, which have been published so far.

They detail such remarkable effects as fast quantum  algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error  correction. A wealth of accompanying figures and exercises illustrate and  develop the material in more depth. They describe what a quantum computer  is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than familiar "classical"  computers, and the real-world implementation of quantum computers. Their  book concludes with an explanation of how quantum states can be used to  perform remarkable feats of communication, and of how it is possible to  protect quantum states against the effects of noise.  }},

Previous work has demonstrated the use of ultra-low-noise transition-edge sensors (TESs) in a QKD system with transmission over 50 km. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the TESs by successfully generating an error-corrected, privacy-amplified key over 148.7 km of dark optical fibre at a mean photon number m = 0.1, or 184.6 km of dark optical fibre at a mean photon number of 0.5. We have also exchanged secret keys over 67.5 km that is secure against powerful photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks.}
