List the main objectives of the proposed research in order of priority [up to 4000 chars]

1. To demonstrate that a type theoretic framework is capable of
efficiently certifying standard and novel quantum algorithms and
protocols.
2.  To develop a framework for certified quantum information
processing which is useful for researchers in the field of quantum
computing who are not specialists in Type Theory.  
3. The integration of concurrency and quantum information
processing in a type theoretic framework.
4. Represent different realisations of quantum computing in one system
to be able to relate and compare them formally.
5. To formally develop methods for compiling quantum programs into an
efficient representation.
6. To represent high level approaches to quantum programming within a
type theoretic framework.
7. To exploit automated and graphical reasoning tools modelling
quantum systems to generate proofs for an interactive theorem prover.
